## For the user

Users can play against the Computer for a first to 7. If they find the CPU easy, they can easily increase the difficulty. But watch out. Hard mode is almost impossible to beat.

## Live Site

You can find the live app here at [Live Page](https://pong-umber.vercel.app/)

## Technical
